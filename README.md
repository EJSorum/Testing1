In this project, I explore writing tests with Jest.

Part of these exercises are coding along with the introductory documents on jestjs.io, such as the section on using matchers:

https://jestjs.io/docs/using-matchers

I also complete all problems in this lesson of the Odin Project:

I also use Babel, Prettier, and Husky in support.
